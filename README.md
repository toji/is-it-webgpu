# Is it WebGPU?

This simple Chrome extension puts an icon in your browser that lights up when a page is using WebGPU
and offers some simple stats about it's usage (How many adapters have been requested, how many
devices, etc.)

It's unlikely that this will be useful for anyone outside of the Chrome GPU team, but I'm publishing
it just in case!
